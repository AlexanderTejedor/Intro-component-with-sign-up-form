## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For the Forms

### What I learned

In this project, I not only learned how to integrate React with Tailwind, but also how to use React-Hook-Formâ€”an excellent tool for handling and validating forms, which was especially helpful for implementing form validation.

```js
{...register('name', {required: true})}
{errors.name && 
     <>
        <img className='absolute top-3.5 right-4' src={errorIcon} alt="Error Icon" />
        <p className='mb-4 text-right text-xs text-red-74 italic'>First Name cannot be empty</p> 
    </>
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue improving my skills with React and TailwindCSS to keep growing.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to use external fonts instead of local ones, so that everyone can identify the type of font I used for this challenge.
